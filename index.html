  <div id="about">
    <p>I’m Kat, a user experience writer and designer, rhetorician, educator, and disability rights activist.
<br>
As a rhetorician, I study bodies--how people live in them, how they appear, how they are augmented, and how they interact with the world around them. 
<br>
As a designer and writer, I am always seeking to improve the experience of those interactions. I use design to remove obstacles, making life more accessible.

    <h3 id=projecttitle class="project1area">Responsive Redesign for disABILITYsa</h3>
    <p id="projectdescript" class="project1area">The goal for this project was to reinvigorate disABILITYsa’s website with a fresh, accessible, and responsive redesign for desktop and mobile. The organization’s purpose is to serve people with disabilities in San Antonio, but the website, in its original state, was not successfully serving its purpose. We would achieve our goal by updating the imagery, iconography, navigation, logo, structure, and overall feel of the site.
