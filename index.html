      <p>I’m Kat, a user experience writer and designer, rhetorician, educator, and disability rights activist. <br>
        <br>
        As a rhetorician, I study bodies--how people live in them, how they appear, how they are augmented, and how
        they interact with the world around them.
        <br>
        As a designer and writer, I am always seeking to improve the experience of those interactions. I use design
        to remove obstacles, making life more accessible.

    <p id="dasadescript">The goal for this project was to reinvigorate disABILITYsa’s website with a fresh, accessible,
      and responsive redesign for desktop and mobile. The organization’s purpose is to serve people with disabilities in
      San Antonio, but the website, in its original state, was not successfully serving its purpose. We would achieve
      our goal by updating the imagery, iconography, navigation, logo, structure, and overall feel of the site.

    <p id="vdescript">
      During this pandemic, running a small restaurant has become an even more complex business with ever changing
      policies and guidelines. The goal of this project was to help local restaurant owners simplify communication
      processes through an app that would allow them to make direct contact with current and potential customers through
      all-in-one social media updates and geofencing ads, increasing business and maintaining a safe environment for
      patrons and staff.

<h3 id="ome"> Here Comes the Time<br> LP Review </h3>
<p id=lpsample>The Austin music scene is simultaneously rich with remarkable artists and hollow with disingenuous hipsters. I didn’t know which I was about to see when Chris Catalena and the Native Americans took the stage at North Door for the “Here Comes the Time” LP release party. However, my jaded bias caused me to think these were just city folk playing cowboy dress up to add an artifice of authenticity to an expected country sound. <br> From the first note, however, this Bryan, Texas native immediately changed my mind. He is a genuine cowboy pianist... </p>

  <h3 id="sami">Strong Athletic <br> Mentally Ill</h3>
  <p>Mental illness is a loaded term. It often has negative connotations that make people really uncomfortable. People with mental illnesses are vilified and trivialized in the media. We are not villains. The daily struggle of having a mental illness is anything but trivial. Mental illness is a disability, and just like any other disability, it requires accommodation and compassion. Part of destigmatizing mental illness is by making it visible; we can’t normalize something if people don’t realize it is already all around them. Be seen, self-stigmatize, be confident: come out disabled...</p>
