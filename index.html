    <p>I’m Kat, a user experience writer and designer, rhetorician, educator, and disability rights activist.
<br>
As a rhetorician, I study bodies--how people live in them, how they appear, how they are augmented, and how they interact with the world around them. 
<br>
As a designer and writer, I am always seeking to improve the experience of those interactions. I use design to remove obstacles, making life more accessible.
