      <p>I’m Kat, a user experience writer and designer, rhetorician, educator, and disability rights activist. <br>
        <br>
        As a rhetorician, I study bodies--how people live in them, how they appear, how they are augmented, <br> and how
        they interact with the world around them.
        <br>
        As a designer and writer, I am always seeking to improve the experience of those interactions. <br>I use design
        to remove obstacles, making life more accessible.

    <h3 id="dasatitle" >Responsive Redesign for disABILITYsa</h3>
    <p id="dasadescript">The goal for this project was to reinvigorate disABILITYsa’s website with a fresh, accessible,
      and responsive redesign for desktop and mobile. The organization’s purpose is to serve people with disabilities in
      San Antonio, but the website, in its original state, was not successfully serving its purpose. We would achieve
      our goal by updating the imagery, iconography, navigation, logo, structure, and overall feel of the site.

    <p id="vdescript">
      During this pandemic, running a small restaurant has become an even more complex business with ever changing
      policies and guidelines. The goal of this project was to help local restaurant owners simplify communication
      processes through an app that would allow them to make direct contact with current and potential customers through
      all-in-one social media updates and geofencing ads, increasing business and maintaining a safe environment for
      patrons and staff
