<h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
<p>Because of the analytical nature, I find building and rebuilding the information archtiecture of 
  sites is not just necessary but also a fun activity. I enjoy the categorization process, the analysis and creativity involved, 
  and the focus on the user's mindset and needs. As the backbone of the site, site maps must be done well or the site's usability will collapse.</p>

  <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
  <p>Thorough usability testing is key t o creating an accessible, user-centerd product. I enjoy the process of presenting a product in-progress
    to potential users, receiving feedback, and iterating the project. The insight of people outside of the designer's head is invaluable.

<h2>PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.  It is a wise father that knows his own child.  He'll go along o'er the wide world with me; 
  Leave me alone to woo him.  It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.</p>

  <h2>CONTENT WRITING AND EDITING</h2>
  <p>I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then
    filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.</p>

        <div class="image-title">Vicinity Mobile App</div>
        <p class="image-description">During this pandemic, running a small restaurant has become an even more complex business with ever changing policies and guidelines. The goal of this project was to help local restaurant owners simplify communication processes through an app that would allow them to make direct contact with current and potential customers through all-in-one social media updates and geofencing ads, increasing business and maintaining a safe environment for patrons and staff.</p>

            <div class="image-title">Responsive Redesign<br> disABILITYsa</div>
            <p class="image-description">The goal for this project was to reinvigorate disABILITYsa’s website with a fresh, accessible, and responsive redesign for desktop and mobile. The organization’s purpose is to serve people with disabilities in San Antonio, but the website, in its original state, was not successfully serving its purpose. We would achieve our goal by updating the imagery, iconography, navigation, logo, structure, and overall feel of the site.</p>
